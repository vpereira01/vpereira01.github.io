This sometimes makes me a bit frustrated since I known a lot about some languages and tools but creating a simple site can seem too much effort.</p>
<p>Now there&rsquo;s ChatGPT, without much effort or skill, here it&rsquo;s a site that shows Electric Grid Power Outages in Portugal <a href="https://vpereira01.com/electricalgridptqos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://vpereira01.com/electricalgridptqos/</a></p>
<p>I have wanted to create such site since I discovered that <a href="https://www.e-redes.pt/en/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">E-REDES</a>, the electrical power distributor, has an API that provides information about outages. Still, I always stopped when I thought the amount of stuff I would have to learn, debug and troubleshoot.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
