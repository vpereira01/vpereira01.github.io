Practicing Go by solving the CodeWars exercise &amp;ldquo;Faberg√© Easter Eggs crush test&amp;rdquo;, I was able to find a simple, and slow solution, by performing many many additions. This simple solution was enough to meet the test requirements but something bugged me from my CPU profilings, z.Add(z, one) was taking cumulative more than one second.</description></item></channel></rss>
