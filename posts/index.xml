Practicing Go by solving the CodeWars exercise &amp;ldquo;Faberg√© Easter Eggs crush test&amp;rdquo;, I was able to find a simple, and slow solution, by performing many many additions. This simple solution was enough to meet the test requirements but something bugged me from my CPU profilings, z.Add(z, one) was taking cumulative more than one second.</description></item><item><title>Hi and site setup</title><link>https://vpereira01.com/posts/hey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 15:59:34 +0100</pubDate><author>vpereira01</author><guid>https://vpereira01.com/posts/hey/</guid><description>Hi and welcome to my site :) For a while I thought it was a good idea to set up a personal site, or blog, but like others I had always postponed it. Recently because I lived through an interesting tech story I finally decided to do it.

Choosing a domain and registrar My GitHub username has ended up being my handle/nick on most professional and tech platforms so reusing it seemed like a good option.</description></item></channel></rss>
