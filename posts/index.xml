This sometimes makes me a bit frustrated since I known a lot about some languages and tools but creating a simple site can seem too much effort.
Now there&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT, without much effort or skill, here it&amp;rsquo;s a site that shows Electric Grid Power Outages in Portugal https://vpereira01.com/electricalgridptqos/ I have wanted to create such site since I discovered that E-REDES , the electrical power distributor, has an API that provides information about outages.</description></item><item><title>Why is Zoom help page broken?
