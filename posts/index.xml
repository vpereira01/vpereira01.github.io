Recently because I lived through an interesting tech story I finally decided to do it.
Since this is my first site/blog please excuse my lacking writing skills.
Choosing a domain and registrar My GitHub username has ended up being my handle/nick on most professional and tech platforms so reusing it seemed like a good option.</description></item></channel></rss>
